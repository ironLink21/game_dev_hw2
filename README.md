# working
- Random Maze Generation & Rendering
- Supports all maze sizes
- Game Scoring
- Basic UI
- High Scores ( this puts all scores in, I don't have them ordered)
- Breadcrumbs
- Shortest Path
- Hint
- Display time taken to solve maze (this is a small bug that doesn't start timer all the way over on each maze creation)

# not working
- Score display toggle (the toggle does work if you debug it,  I'm having an issue where it won't update the instance variable so it isScoreVisible always shows false on toggle)
